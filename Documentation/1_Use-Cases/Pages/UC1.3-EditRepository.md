Each use case represents a specific interaction requirement from the User/Actor perspective. This page details the following:
- [Intended Workflow](#intended-workflow) which details the order of actions and describes actor decision points.
- [Sequence Diagram](#sequence-diagram) which models the flow of logic between actors and components in the system

# Intended Workflow

A workflow is a description of a set of tasks that are necessary to accomplish a given goal for a given actor or actors. The intended workflow breaks a given use case down into actor starting and end points, actions, and decision points to describe actions as well as relationships between actions. Library documents require a list of preconditions for the workflow, and a description of the actions in the workflow to accompany the diagram.

#### Preconditions
* Publisher, SME has an account with the system (becoms Publisher, SME Registered User)
* Publisher, SME Registered User is logged into the system 

#### Text Description

#### Text Description 
 
An SME, Publisher Registered User who is logged in interacts with User Interface (UI) and Data Service components in the following manner:
1. They view the repository list in the UI
2. They select view details of a specific repository
    - UI passes the repository detail request to the Data Service
    - Data Service passes information to display the repository detail information in the UI
3.  They View Provenance (see [UC1.4 View Provenance](https://github.com/NIH-NICHD-Ecosystem/E1_Data-Repository-Finder/blob/main/Documentation/1_Use-Cases/Pages/UC1.4-ViewProvenance.md))
4. They view the information fields
5. They type in information
6. They select items, or paste items
7. They add notes
8. They select to save a draft in the UI
    - UI validates field content
    - UI sends the information state to the Data Service
    - Data Service updates draft entry
    - Data Services sends the update to display in the UI
9. They indicate "ready to review" in the UI
    - UI sends the information state to the Data Services
    - Data Services flags the repository as ready to publish
